\s1 The Conquest of Canaan Proceeds
\r (Joshua 13:1–7)
\b
\m 
\v 1 After the death of Joshua, the Israelites inquired of the LORD, “Who will be the first to go up and fight for us against the Canaanites?” 
\b
\m 
\v 2 “Judah shall go up,” answered the LORD. “Indeed, I have delivered the land into their hands.” 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Then the men of Judah said to their brothers the Simeonites, “Come up with us to our allotted territory, and let us fight against the Canaanites. And we likewise will go with you to your territory.” So the Simeonites went with them. 
\b
\m 
\v 4 When Judah attacked, the LORD delivered the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands, and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek. 
\v 5 And there they found Adoni-bezek and fought against him, striking down the Canaanites and Perizzites. 
\b
\m 
\v 6 As Adoni-bezek fled, they pursued him, seized him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes. 
\v 7 Then Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have gathered the scraps under my table. As I have done to them, so God has repaid me.” And they brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. 
\s1 The Capture of Jerusalem and Hebron
\r (Joshua 15:13–19)
\b
\m 
\v 8 Then the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire. 
\v 9 Afterward, the men of Judah marched down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, in the Negev, and in the foothills.\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Hebrew Shephelah or lowlands; that is, the western foothills of Judea\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 10 Judah also marched against the Canaanites who were living in Hebron (formerly known as Kiriath-arba), and they struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. 
\b
\m 
\v 11 From there they marched against the inhabitants of Debir (formerly known as Kiriath-sepher). 
\v 12 And Caleb said, “To the man who strikes down Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage.” 
\v 13 So Othniel son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz captured the city, and Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage.
