\v 3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms. 
\v 4 For He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in His presence. In love 
\v 5 He predestined us for adoption as His sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will, 
\v 6 to the praise of His glorious grace, which He has freely given us in the Beloved One. 
\b

\v 7 In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace 
\v 8 that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding. 
\v 9 And He has made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ 
\v 10 as a plan for the fullness of time, to bring all things in heaven and on earth together in Christ. 
\b
\m 
\v 11 In Him we were also chosen as God’s own, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything by the counsel of His will, 
\v 12 in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, would be for the praise of His glory. 
\b
\m 
\v 13 And in Him, having heard and believed the word of truth—the gospel of your salvation—you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, 
\v 14 who is the pledge of our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession, to the praise of His glory.
