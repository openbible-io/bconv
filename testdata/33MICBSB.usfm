\v 1 This is the word of the LORD that came to Micah the Moreshite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah—what he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem: 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 Hear, O peoples, all of you; 
\q2 listen, O earth, and everyone in it! 
\q1 May the Lord GOD bear witness against you, 
\q2 the Lord from His holy temple. 
\q1 
\v 3 For behold, the LORD comes forth 
\q2 from His dwelling place; 
\q1 He will come down and tread 
\q2 on the high places of the earth. 
\q1 
\v 4 The mountains will melt beneath Him, 
\q2 and the valleys will split apart, 
\q1 like wax before the fire, 
\q2 like water rushing down a slope. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 All this is for the transgression of Jacob 
\q2 and the sins of the house of Israel. 
\q1 What is the transgression of Jacob? 
\q2 Is it not Samaria? 
\q1 And what is the high place of Judah? 
\q2 Is it not Jerusalem? 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 Therefore I will make Samaria 
\q2 a heap of rubble in the open field, 
\q2 a planting area for a vineyard.
