\s1 The Supremacy of the Son
\r (Colossians 1:15–23)
\b
\m 
\v 1 On many past occasions and in many different ways, God spoke to our fathers through the prophets. 
\v 2 But in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son,\f + \fr 1:2 \ft Or in His Son\f* whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom He made the universe.\f + \fr 1:2 \ft Or the world; literally the ages\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 3 The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His nature, upholding all things by His powerful word. After He had provided purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. 
\v 4 So He became as far superior to the angels as the name He has inherited is excellent beyond theirs. 
\v 5 For to which of the angels did God ever say: 
\b
\q1 “You are My Son; 
\q2 today I have become Your Father”\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Psalm 2:7; literally today I have begotten You\f*? 
\b
\m Or again: 
\b
\q1 “I will be His Father, 
\q2 and He will be My Son”\f + \fr 1:5 \ft 2 Samuel 7:14; 1 Chronicles 17:13\f*? 
\b
\m 
\v 6 And again, when God brings His firstborn into the world, He says: 
\b
\q1 “Let all God’s angels worship Him.”\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Deuteronomy 32:43 (see DSS and LXX)\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 7 Now about the angels He says: 
\b
\q1 “He makes His angels winds, 
\q2 His servants flames of fire.”\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Psalm 104:4 (see also LXX)\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 8 But about the Son He says: 
\b
