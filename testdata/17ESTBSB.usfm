\s1 Xerxes’ Royal Feast
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is what happened in the days of Xerxes,\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Hebrew Ahasuerus; here and throughout Esther \f* who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.\f + \fr 1:1 \ft That is, the upper Nile region\f* 
\v 2 In those days King Xerxes sat on his royal throne in the citadel of Susa. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 In the third year of his reign, Xerxes held a feast for all his officials and servants. The military leaders of Persia and Media were there, along with the nobles and princes of the provinces. 
\v 4 And for a full 180 days he displayed the glorious riches of his kingdom and the magnificent splendor of his greatness. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 At the end of this time, in the garden court of the royal palace, the king held a seven-day feast for all the people in the citadel of Susa, from the least to the greatest. 
\v 6 Hangings of white and blue linen were fastened with cords of fine white and purple material to silver rings on the marble pillars. Gold and silver couches were arranged on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and other costly stones. 
\b
\m 
\v 7 Beverages were served in an array of goblets of gold, each with a different design, and the royal wine flowed freely, according to the king’s bounty. 
\v 8 By order of the king, no limit was placed on the drinking, and every official of his household was to serve each man whatever he desired. 
\s1 Queen Vashti’s Refusal
\b
\m 
\v 9 Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes. 
\b
\m 
\v 10 On the seventh day, when the king’s heart was merry with wine, he ordered the seven eunuchs who served him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas—
\v 11 to bring Queen Vashti before him, wearing her royal crown, to display her beauty to the people and officials. For she was beautiful to behold. 
\b
\m 
\v 12 Queen Vashti, however, refused to come at the king’s command brought by his eunuchs. And the king became furious, and his anger burned within him. 
\s1 Queen Vashti Deposed
\b
\m 
\v 13 Then the king consulted the wise men who knew the times, for it was customary for him to confer with the experts in law and justice. 
\v 14 His closest advisors were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media who had personal access to the king and ranked highest in the kingdom.
