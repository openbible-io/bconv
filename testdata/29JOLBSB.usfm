\s1 The Invasion of Locusts
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is the word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel: 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 Hear this, O elders; 
\q2 and give ear, all who dwell in the land. 
\q1 Has anything like this ever happened in your days 
\q2 or in the days of your fathers? 
\q1 
\v 3 Tell it to your children; 
\q2 let your children tell it to their children, 
\q2 and their children to the next generation. 
\q1 
\v 4 What the devouring locust has left, 
\q2 the swarming locust has eaten; 
\q1 what the swarming locust has left, 
\q2 the young locust has eaten; 
\q1 and what the young locust has left, 
\q2 the destroying locust has eaten.\f + \fr 1:4 \ft The precise identification of the four kinds of locusts mentioned here is uncertain.\f* 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 Wake up, you drunkards, and weep; 
\q2 wail, all you drinkers of wine, 
\q1 because of the sweet wine, 
\q2 for it has been cut off from your mouth. 
\q1 
\v 6 For a nation has invaded My land, 
\q2 powerful and without number; 
\q1 its teeth are the teeth of a lion, 
\q2 and its fangs are the fangs of a lioness. 
\q1 
\v 7 It has laid waste My grapevine
