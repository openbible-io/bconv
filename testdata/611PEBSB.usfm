\s1 A Greeting from Peter
\r (2 Peter 1:1–2)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, 
\b
\m To the elect who are exiles of the Dispersion throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, chosen \f + \fr 1:1 \ft Literally To the elect sojourners of the Diaspora of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. These provinces were located in what is now Turkey.\f* 
\v 2 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father and sanctified by the Spirit for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by His blood: 
\b
\m Grace and peace be yours in abundance. 
\s1 A Living Hope
\b
\m 
\v 3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By His great mercy He has given us new birth \f + \fr 1:3 \ft Or has caused us to be born again or has begotten us again\f* into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
\v 4 and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, reserved in heaven for you, 
\v 5 who through faith are shielded by God’s power for the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. 
\b
\m 
\v 6 In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in various trials 
\v 7 so that the proven character of your faith—more precious than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 Though you have not seen Him, you love Him; and though you do not see Him now, you believe in Him and rejoice with an inexpressible and glorious joy, 
\v 9 now that you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls. 
\b
\m 
\v 10 Concerning this salvation, the prophets who foretold the grace to come to you searched and investigated carefully, 
\v 11 trying to determine the time and setting to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. 
\b
\m 
\v 12 It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, when they foretold the things now announced by those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things. 
\s1 A Call to Holiness
\r (Hebrews 12:14–17)
\b
