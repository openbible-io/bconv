\s1 A Greeting from Peter
\r (1 Peter 1:1–2)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, 
\b
\m To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours: 
\b
\m 
\v 2 Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. 
\s1 Partakers of the Divine Nature
\b
\m 
\v 3 His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own \f + \fr 1:3 \ft Or to His own\f* glory and excellence. 
\v 4 Through these He has given us His precious and magnificent promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, now that you have escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; 
\v 6 and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; 
\v 7 and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. 
\v 8 For if you possess these qualities and continue to grow in them, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 9 But whoever lacks these traits is nearsighted to the point of blindness, having forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins. 
\b
\m 
\v 10 Therefore, brothers, strive to make your calling and election sure. For if you practice these things you will never stumble, 
\v 11 and you will receive a lavish reception into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 
\b
\m 
\v 12 Therefore I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are established in the truth you now have. 
\v 13 I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of my body,\f + \fr 1:13 \ft Literally as long as I am in this tent\f* 
\v 14 because I know that this tent will soon be laid aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. 
\v 15 And I will make every effort to ensure that after my departure, you will be able to recall these things at all times. 
\s1 Eyewitnesses of His Majesty
