\s1 The Word of Life
\r (Luke 24:36–49; John 20:19–23)
\b
\m 
\v 1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our own eyes, which we have gazed upon and touched with our own hands—this is the Word of life. 
\v 2 And this is the life that was revealed; we have seen it and testified to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And this fellowship of ours is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ. 
\v 4 We write these things so that our \f + \fr 1:4 \ft BYZ and TR your\f* joy may be complete. 
\s1 Walking in the Light
\r (John 8:12–29)
\b
\m 
\v 5 And this is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you: God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. 
\v 6 If we say we have fellowship with Him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. 
\v 7 But \f + \fr 1:7 \ft NA does not include But.\f* if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 
\v 9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 
\v 10 If we say we have not sinned, we make Him out to be a liar, and His word is not in us. 
\c 2
\s1 Jesus Our Advocate
\b
\m 
\v 1 My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate before the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. 
\v 2 He Himself is the atoning sacrifice \f + \fr 2:2 \ft Or the propitiation\f* for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 By this we can be sure that we have come to know Him: if we keep His commandments. 
\v 4 If anyone says, “I know Him,” but does not keep His commandments, he is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 
\v 5 But if anyone keeps His word, the love of God has been truly perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him: 
\v 6 Whoever claims to abide in Him must walk as Jesus walked.
