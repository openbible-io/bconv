\s1 A Call to Rebuild the Temple
\r (Ezra 5:1–5)
\b
\m 
\v 1 In the second year of the reign of Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak,\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Jehozadak is a variant of Jozadak; also in verses 12 and 14; see Ezra 3:2.\f* the high priest, stating 
\v 2 that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: 
\b
\q1 “These people say, ‘The time has not yet come 
\q2 to rebuild the house of the LORD.’” 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Then the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet, saying: 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 “Is it a time for you yourselves 
\q2 to live in your paneled houses, 
\q2 while this house lies in ruins?” 
\b
\m 
\v 5 Now this is what the LORD of Hosts says: 
\b
\q1 “Consider carefully your ways. 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 You have planted much 
\q2 but harvested little. 
\q1 You eat but never have enough. 
\q2 You drink but never have your fill. 
\q1 You put on clothes but never get warm. 
\q2 You earn wages to put into a bag pierced through.” 
\b
\m 
\v 7 This is what the LORD of Hosts says: 
\b
