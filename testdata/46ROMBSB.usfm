\s1 Paul Greets the Saints in Rome
\b
\m 
\v 1 Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, and set apart for the gospel of God—
\v 2 the gospel He promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures, 
\v 3 regarding His Son, who was a descendant of David according to the flesh, 
\v 4 and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by His resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 Through Him and on behalf of His name, we received grace and apostleship to call all those among the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith. 
\v 6 And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ. 
\b
\m 
\v 7 To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: 
\b
\m Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\s1 Unashamed of the Gospel
\b
\m 
\v 8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed all over the world. 
\v 9 God, whom I serve with my spirit \f + \fr 1:9 \ft Or in my spirit\f* in preaching the gospel of His Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you 
\v 10 in my prayers at all times, asking that now at last by God’s will I may succeed in coming to you. 
\v 11 For I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you, 
\v 12 that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith. 
\b
\m 
\v 13 I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, how often I planned to come to you (but have been prevented from visiting \f + \fr 1:13 \ft Literally but have been prevented\f* until now), in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles. 
\v 14 I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks,\f + \fr 1:14 \ft Literally to Greeks and barbarians\f* both to the wise and the foolish. 
\v 15 That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome. 
\b
\m 
\v 16 I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, then to the Greek. 
\v 17 For the gospel reveals the righteousness of God that comes by faith from start to finish,\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Literally For in it is revealed the righteousness of God from faith to faith\f* just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Habakkuk 2:4\f*
