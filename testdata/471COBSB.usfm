\s1 Greetings from Paul and Sosthenes
\r (Acts 18:1–11; 2 Corinthians 1:1–2)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes, 
\b
\m 
\v 2 To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours: 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\s1 Thanksgiving
\r (Philippians 1:3–11; Colossians 1:3–14)
\b
\m 
\v 4 I always thank my God for you because of the grace He has given you in Christ Jesus. 
\v 5 For in Him you have been enriched in every way, in all speech and all knowledge, 
\v 6 because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in you. 
\b
\m 
\v 7 Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 8 He will sustain you to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 9 God, who has called you into fellowship with His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful. 
\s1 Unity in the Church
\r (Psalm 133:1–3; Ephesians 4:1–16)
\b
\m 
\v 10 I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree together, so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be united in mind and conviction. 
\v 11 My brothers, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you. 
\v 12 What I mean is this: Individuals among you are saying, “I follow Paul,” “I follow Apollos,” “I follow Cephas,”\f + \fr 1:12 \ft That is, Peter\f* or “I follow Christ.” 
\b
\m 
\v 13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into the name of Paul? 
\v 14 I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
