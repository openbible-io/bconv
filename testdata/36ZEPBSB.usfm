\s1 Zephaniah Prophesies Judgment on Judah
\r (Matthew 13:36–43)
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is the word of the LORD that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah: 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 “I will completely sweep away 
\q2 everything from the face of the earth,” 
\qr declares the LORD. 
\q1 
\v 3 “I will sweep away man and beast; 
\q2 I will sweep away the birds of the air, 
\q1 and the fish of the sea, 
\q2 and the idols with their wicked worshipers.\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Or and the idols that cause the wicked to stumble\f* 
\q1 I will cut off mankind 
\q2 from the face of the earth,” 
\qr declares the LORD. 
\q1 
\v 4 “I will stretch out My hand against Judah 
\q2 and against all who dwell in Jerusalem. 
\q1 I will cut off from this place every remnant of Baal, 
\q2 the names of the idolatrous and pagan priests—
\q1 
\v 5 those who bow on the rooftops 
\q2 to worship the host of heaven, 
\q1 those who bow down and swear by the LORD 
\q2 but also swear by Milcom,\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Or by their king; Milcom is a variant of Molech; see Leviticus 18:21 and 1 Kings 11:7.\f* 
\q1 
\v 6 and those who turn back 
\q2 from following the LORD, 
\q1 neither seeking the LORD 
\q2 nor inquiring of Him.” 
\s1 The Day of the LORD
