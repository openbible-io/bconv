\s1 Rejoicing in Trials
\r (Philippians 1:12–20)
\b
\m 
\v 2 Consider it pure joy, my brothers, when you encounter trials of many kinds, 
\v 3 because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. 
\v 4 Allow perseverance to finish its work, so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. 
\v 6 But he must ask in faith, without doubting, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. 
\v 7 That man should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. 
\v 8 He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. 
\b
\m 
\v 9 The brother in humble circumstances should exult in his high position. 
\v 10 But the one who is rich should exult in his low position, because he will pass away like a flower of the field. 
\v 11 For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its flower falls and its beauty is lost. So too, the rich man will fade away in the midst of his pursuits. 
\b
\m 
\v 12 Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love Him. 
\s1 Good and Perfect Gifts
\b
\m 
\v 13 When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone.
