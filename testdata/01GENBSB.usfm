\s1 The Creation
\r (John 1:1–5; Hebrews 11:1–3)
\b

\v 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
\b
\m 
\v 2 Now the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. 
\s2 The First Day
\b
\pmo 
\v 3 And God said, “Let there be light,” \f + \fr 1:3 \ft Cited in 2 Corinthians 4:6\f* and there was light. 
\v 4 And God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness. 
\v 5 God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.” 
\b
\pmo And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Literally day one\f* 
\s2 The Second Day
\b
\pmo 
\v 6 And God said, “Let there be an expanse \f + \fr 1:6 \ft Or a canopy or a firmament or a vault; also in verses 7, 8, 14, 15, 17, and 20\f* between the waters, to separate the waters from the waters.” 
\v 7 So God made the expanse and separated the waters beneath it from the waters above. And it was so. 
\v 8 God called the expanse “sky.” 
\b
\pmo And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day. 
\s2 The Third Day
\b
\pmo 
\v 9 And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered into one place, so that the dry land may appear.” And it was so. 
\v 10 God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering of waters He called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 11 Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees, each bearing fruit with seed according to its kind.” And it was so. 
\v 12 The earth produced vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
