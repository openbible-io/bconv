\s1 Greetings from Paul and Timothy
\r (Colossians 1:1–2; Philemon 1:1–3)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, 
\b
\m To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons: 
\b
\m 
\v 2 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\s1 Thanksgiving and Prayer
\r (1 Corinthians 1:4–9; Colossians 1:3–14)
\b
\m 
\v 3 I thank my God every time I remember you. 
\v 4 In every prayer for all of you, I always pray with joy, 
\v 5 because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, 
\v 6 being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. 
\b
\m 
\v 7 It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart. For in my chains and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partners in grace with me. 
\v 8 God is my witness how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. 
\b
\m 
\v 9 And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, 
\v 10 so that you may be able to test and prove what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, 
\v 11 filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. 
\s1 Paul’s Trials Advance the Gospel
\r (James 1:2–12)
\b
\m 
\v 12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that my circumstances have actually served to advance the gospel. 
\v 13 As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard \f + \fr 1:13 \ft Or all the Praetorium\f* and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. 
\v 14 And most of the brothers, confident in the Lord by my chains, now dare more greatly to speak the word \f + \fr 1:14 \ft NE and WH the word of God\f* without fear.
