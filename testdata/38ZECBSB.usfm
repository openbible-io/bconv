\b
\m 
\v 2 “The LORD was very angry with your fathers. 
\v 3 So tell the people that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Return to Me, declares the LORD of Hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of Hosts.’ 
\b
\m 
\v 4 Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Turn now from your evil ways and deeds.’ 
\b
\m But they did not listen or pay attention to Me, declares the LORD. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 Where are your fathers now? And the prophets, do they live forever? 
\v 6 But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? They repented and said, ‘Just as the LORD of Hosts purposed to do to us according to our ways and deeds, so He has done to us.’”
