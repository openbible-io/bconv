\v 3 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, 
\v 4 because we have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all the saints—
\v 5 the faith and love proceeding from the hope stored up for you in heaven, of which you have already heard in the word of truth, the gospel 
\v 6 that has come to you.

\m All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood the grace of God.

\v 8 and who also informed us of your love in the Spirit. 
\b
\m 
\v 9 For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, 
\v 10 so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord and may please Him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, 
\v 11 being strengthened with all power according to His glorious might so that you may have full endurance and patience, and joyfully 
\v 12 giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you \f + \fr 1:12 \ft BYZ and TR us\f* to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.
