\s1 Elijah Denounces Ahaziah
\r (1 Kings 22:51–53)
\b
\m 
\v 1 After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel. 
\b
\m 
\v 2 Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers and instructed them: “Go inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this injury.” 
\b
\m 
\v 3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are on your way to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?’ 
\v 4 Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘You will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.’” 
\b
\m So Elijah departed. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, “Why have you returned?” 
\b
\m 
\v 6 They replied, “A man came up to meet us and said, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and tell him that this is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending these men to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.’” 
\b
\m 
\v 7 The king asked them, “What sort of man came up to meet you and spoke these words to you?” 
\b
\m 
\v 8 “He was a hairy man,\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Or He had a garment of hair\f*” they answered, “with a leather belt around his waist.” 
\b
\m “It was Elijah the Tishbite,” said the king. 
\b
\m 
\v 9 Then King Ahaziah sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. So the captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on top of a hill, and said to him, “Man of God, the king declares, ‘Come down!’” 
\b
\m 
\v 10 Elijah answered the captain, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.”
