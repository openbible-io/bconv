\s1 Prologue
\r (Luke 1:1–4)
\b
\m 
\v 1 In my first book, O Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach, 
\v 2 until the day He was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles He had chosen. 
\v 3 After His suffering, He presented Himself to them with many convincing proofs that He was alive. He appeared to them over a span of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. 
\b
\m 
\v 4 And while they were gathered together,\f + \fr 1:4 \ft Or eating together\f* He commanded them: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift the Father promised, which you have heard Me discuss. 
\v 5 For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Or For John baptized in water, but in a few days you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit; cited in Acts 11:16\f*”

\v 8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be My witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” 
\b
\m 
\v 9 After He had said this, they watched as He was taken up, and a cloud hid Him from their sight. 
\v 10 They were looking intently into the sky as He was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. 
\v 11 “Men of Galilee,” they said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen Him go into heaven.” 
\s1 Matthias Replaces Judas
\b
\m 
\v 12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near the city, a Sabbath day’s journey away.\f + \fr 1:12 \ft A Sabbath day’s journey is 2,000 cubits (approximately 3,000 feet or 914.4 meters)\f* 
\v 13 When they arrived, they went to the upper room where they were staying: Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. 
\v 14 With one accord they all continued in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.

\v 15 In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (a gathering of about a hundred and twenty) and said,
