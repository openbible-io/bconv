\s1 Jonah Flees from the LORD
\r (Nahum 1:1–15)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai, saying, 
\v 2 “Get up! Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before Me.” 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Jonah, however, got up to flee to Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD. He went down to Joppa and found a ship bound for Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went aboard to sail for Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD. 
\s1 The Great Storm
\r (Acts 27:13–26)
\b
\m 
\v 4 Then the LORD hurled a great wind upon the sea, and such a violent storm arose that the ship was in danger of breaking apart. 
\v 5 The sailors were afraid, and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the ship’s cargo into the sea to lighten the load. But Jonah had gone down to the lowest part of the vessel, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep. 
\b
\m 
\v 6 The captain approached him and said, “How can you sleep? Get up and call upon your God. Perhaps this God will consider us, so that we may not perish.” 
\b
\m 
\v 7 “Come!” said the sailors to one another. “Let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity that is upon us.” 
\b
\m So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 “Tell us now,” they demanded, “who is to blame for this calamity that is upon us? What is your occupation, and where have you come from? What is your country, and who are your people?” 
\b
\m 
\v 9 “I am a Hebrew,” replied Jonah. “I worship the LORD, the God of the heavens, who made the sea and the dry land.” 
\b
\m 
\v 10 Then the men were even more afraid and said to him, “What have you done?” The men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.
