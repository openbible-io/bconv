\s1 Dedication to Theophilus
\r (Acts 1:1–3)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Many have undertaken to compose an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, 
\v 2 just as they were handed down to us by the initial eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 
\v 3 Therefore, having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 
\v 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. 
\s1 Gabriel Foretells John’s Birth
\b
\m 
\v 5 In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah, and whose wife Elizabeth was a daughter of Aaron. 
\v 6 Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and decrees of the Lord. 
\v 7 But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well along in years. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 One day while Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, 
\v 9 he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 
\v 10 And at the hour of the incense offering, the whole congregation was praying outside. 
\b
\m 
\v 11 Just then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 
\v 12 When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and gripped with fear. 
\b
\m 
\v 13 But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John. 
\v 14 He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice at his birth, 
\v 15 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He shall never take wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb. 
\v 16 Many of the sons of Israel he will turn back to the Lord their God. 
\v 17 And he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children \f + \fr 1:17 \ft Malachi 4:5–6\f* and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.” 
\b
\m 
\v 18 “How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years.”
