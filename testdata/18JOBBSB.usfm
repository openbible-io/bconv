\s1 Job’s Character and Wealth
\r (James 5:7–12)
\b
\m 
\v 1 There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And this man was blameless and upright, fearing God and shunning evil. 
\v 2 He had seven sons and three daughters, 
\v 3 and he owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a very large number of servants. Job was the greatest man of all the people of the East. 
\b
\m 
\v 4 Job’s sons would take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 And when the days of feasting were over, Job would send for his children to purify them, rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for all of them. For Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular practice. 
\s1 Satan’s First Attack
\b
\m 
\v 6 One day the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan \f + \fr 1:6 \ft That is, the Accuser or the Adversary; here and throughout Job 1\f* also came with them. 
\b
\m 
\v 7 “Where have you come from?” said the LORD to Satan. 
\b
\m “From roaming through the earth,” he replied, “and walking back and forth in it.” 
\b
\m 
\v 8 Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one on earth like him, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil.” 
\b
\m 
\v 9 Satan answered the LORD, “Does Job fear God for nothing? 
\v 10 Have You not placed a hedge on every side around him and his household and all that he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. 
\v 11 But stretch out Your hand and strike all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face.” 
\b
\m 
\v 12 “Very well,” said the LORD to Satan. “Everything he has is in your hands, but you must not lay a hand on the man himself.” 
\b
