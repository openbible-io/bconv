\s1 Elkanah and His Wives
\r (Psalm 113:1–9)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Now there was a man named Elkanah who was from Ramathaim-zophim \f + \fr 1:1 \ft Or from Ramathaim, a Zuphite; see LXX and 1 Chronicles 6:26 and 35.\f* in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu,\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Elihu is also called Eliab and Eliel; see 1 Chronicles 6:27 and 34.\f* the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 
\v 2 He had two wives, one named Hannah and the other Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Year after year Elkanah would go up from his city to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts at Shiloh, where Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the LORD. 
\v 4 And whenever the day came for Elkanah to present his sacrifice, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. 
\v 5 But to Hannah he would give a double portion,\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Or a choice portion\f* for he loved her even though the LORD had closed her womb. 
\b
\m 
\v 6 Because the LORD had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival would provoke her and taunt her viciously. 
\v 7 And this went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival taunted her until she wept and would not eat. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 “Hannah, why are you crying?” her husband Elkanah asked. “Why won’t you eat? Why is your heart so grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” 
\s1 Hannah Prays for a Son
\b
\m 
\v 9 So after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD. 
\b
\m 
\v 10 In her bitter distress, Hannah prayed to the LORD and wept with many tears. 
\v 11 And she made a vow, pleading, “O LORD of Hosts, if only You will look upon the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, not forgetting Your maidservant but giving her a son, then I will dedicate him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall ever come over his head.” 
\b
\m 
\v 12 As Hannah kept on praying before the LORD, Eli watched her mouth. 
\v 13 Hannah was praying in her heart, and though her lips were moving, her voice could not be heard. 
\b
\m So Eli thought she was drunk 
\v 14 and said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine!” 
\b
