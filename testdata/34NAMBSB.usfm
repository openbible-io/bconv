\s1 The Burden against Nineveh
\r (Jonah 1:1–3)
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is the burden against Nineveh, the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite: 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; 
\q2 the LORD is avenging and full of wrath. 
\q1 The LORD takes vengeance on His foes 
\q2 and reserves wrath for His enemies. 
\q1 
\v 3 The LORD is slow to anger 
\q2 and great in power; 
\q1 the LORD will by no means 
\q2 leave the guilty unpunished. 
\q1 His path is in the whirlwind and storm, 
\q2 and clouds are the dust beneath His feet. 
\q1 
\v 4 He rebukes the sea and dries it up; 
\q2 He makes all the rivers run dry. 
\q1 Bashan and Carmel wither, 
\q2 and the flower of Lebanon wilts. 
\q1 
\v 5 The mountains quake before Him, 
\q2 and the hills melt away; 
\q1 the earth trembles at His presence—
\q2 the world and all its dwellers. 
\q1 
\v 6 Who can withstand His indignation? 
\q2 Who can endure His burning anger? 
\q1 His wrath is poured out like fire; 
\q2 even rocks are shattered before Him. 
\b
