\s1 Paul’s Greeting to the Galatians
\b
\m 
\v 1 Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead—
\v 2 and all the brothers with me,

\v 14 I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
