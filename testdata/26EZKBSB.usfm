\s1 Ezekiel’s Vision by the River Kebar
\r (Psalm 137:1–9)
\b
\m 
\v 1 In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was among the exiles by the River Kebar, the heavens opened and I saw visions of God.\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Or from God\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 2 On the fifth day of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin—
\v 3 the word of the LORD came directly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans \f + \fr 1:3 \ft That is, the Babylonians\f* by the River Kebar. And there the LORD’s hand was upon him. 
\s1 The Four Living Creatures
\b
\m 
\v 4 I looked and saw a whirlwind coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing back and forth and brilliant light all around it. In the center of the fire was a gleam like amber,\f + \fr 1:4 \ft Or The center of the fire looked like glowing metal; similarly in verse 27\f* 
\v 5 and within it was the form of four living creatures. 
\b
\m And this was their appearance: They had a human form, 
\v 6 but each had four faces and four wings. 
\v 7 Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the hooves of a calf, gleaming like polished bronze. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four living creatures had faces and wings, 
\v 9 and their wings were touching one another. They did not turn as they moved; each one went straight ahead. 
\b
\m 
\v 10 The form of their faces was that of a man, and each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and also the face of an eagle. 
\v 11 Such were their faces. 
\b
\m Their wings were spread upward; each had two wings touching the wings of the creature on either side, and two wings covering its body. 
\v 12 Each creature went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they moved. 
\b
\m 
\v 13 In the midst of the living creatures was the appearance of glowing coals of fire, or of torches. Fire moved back and forth between the living creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. 
\v 14 The creatures were darting back and forth as quickly as flashes of lightning.
