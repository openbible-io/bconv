\s1 Saul’s Death Reported to David
\r (1 Samuel 31:1–6; 1 Chronicles 10:1–6)
\b
\m 
\v 1 After the death of Saul, David returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days. 
\v 2 On the third day a man with torn clothes and dust on his head arrived from Saul’s camp. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him homage. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 “Where have you come from?” David asked. 
\b
\m “I have escaped from the Israelite camp,” he replied. 
\b
\m 
\v 4 “What was the outcome?” David asked. “Please tell me.” 
\b
\m “The troops fled from the battle,” he replied. “Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.” 
\b
\m 
\v 5 Then David asked the young man who had brought him the report, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” 
\b
\m 
\v 6 “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,” he replied, “and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and the cavalry closing in on him. 
\v 7 When he turned around and saw me, he called out and I answered, ‘Here I am!’ 
\b
\m 
\v 8 ‘Who are you?’ he asked. 
\b
\m So I told him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ 
\b
\m 
\v 9 Then he begged me, ‘Stand over me and kill me, for agony has seized me, but my life still lingers.’ 
\b
\m 
\v 10 So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”
