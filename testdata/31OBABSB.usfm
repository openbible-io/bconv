\s1 The Destruction of Edom
\r (Jeremiah 49:7–22)
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is the vision of Obadiah: 
\b
\q1 This is what the Lord GOD says about Edom—
\b
\q1 We have heard a message from the LORD; 
\q2 an envoy has been sent among the nations 
\q1 to say, “Rise up, 
\q2 and let us go to battle against her!”—
\b
\q1 
\v 2 “Behold, I will make you small among the nations; 
\q2 you will be deeply despised. 
\q1 
\v 3 The pride of your heart has deceived you, 
\q2 O dwellers in the clefts of the rocks \f + \fr 1:3 \ft Or in the retreats of Sela\f* 
\q2 whose habitation is the heights, 
\q1 who say in your heart, 
\q2 ‘Who can bring me down to the ground?’ 
\q1 
\v 4 Though you soar like the eagle 
\q2 and make your nest among the stars, 
\q2 even from there I will bring you down,” 
\qr declares the LORD. 
\q1 
\v 5 “If thieves came to you, 
\q2 if robbers by night—
\q1 oh, how you will be ruined—
\q2 would they not steal only what they wanted? 
\q1 If grape gatherers came to you, 
\q2 would they not leave some gleanings?
