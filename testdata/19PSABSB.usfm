\s1 The Two Paths
\r (Matthew 5:3–12; Luke 6:20–23)
\b
\q1 Blessed is the man 
\q2 who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, 
\q1 or set foot on the path of sinners, 
\q2 or sit in the seat of mockers. 
\q1 
\v 2 But his delight is in the Law of the LORD, 
\q2 and on His law he meditates day and night. 
\q1 
\v 3 He is like a tree planted by streams of water, 
\q2 yielding its fruit in season, 
\q1 whose leaf does not wither, 
\q2 and who prospers in all he does. 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 Not so the wicked! 
\q2 For they are like chaff driven off by the wind. 
\q1 
\v 5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, 
\q2 nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 For the LORD guards the path of the righteous, 
\q2 but the way of the wicked will perish.

\r (Acts 4:23–31)
\b
\q1 Why do the nations rage \f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or noisily assemble; see Revelation 11:18.\f* 
\q2 and the peoples plot in vain?
