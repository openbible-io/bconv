\b
\m 
\v 9 I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance that are in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and my testimony about Jesus.

\v 11 saying,\f + \fr 1:11 \ft TR saying, “I am Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last,” and,\f* “Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”
