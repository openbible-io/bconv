\s1 Naomi Becomes a Widow
\r (1 Timothy 5:3–16)
\b
\m 
\v 1 In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. And a certain man from Bethlehem in Judah, with his wife and two sons, went to reside in the land of Moab. 
\v 2 The man’s name was Elimelech, his wife’s name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah, and they entered the land of Moab and settled there. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Then Naomi’s husband Elimelech died, and she was left with her two sons, 
\v 4 who took Moabite women as their wives, one named Orpah and the other named Ruth. 
\b
\m And after they had lived in Moab about ten years, 
\v 5 both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and without her husband. 
\s1 Ruth’s Loyalty to Naomi
\b
\m 
\v 6 When Naomi heard in Moab that the LORD had attended to His people by providing them with food, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to leave the land of Moab. 
\v 7 Accompanied by her two daughters-in-law, she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road leading back to the land of Judah. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you to your mother’s home. May the LORD show you loving devotion,\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Forms of the Hebrew chesed are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as loving devotion; the range of meaning includes love, goodness, kindness, faithfulness, and mercy, as well as loyalty to a covenant.\f* as you have shown to your dead and to me. 
\v 9 May the LORD enable each of you to find rest in the home of your new husband.” 
\b
\m And she kissed them as they wept aloud 
\v 10 and said, “Surely we will return with you to your people.” 
\b
\m 
\v 11 But Naomi replied, “Return home, my daughters. Why would you go with me? Are there still sons in my womb to become your husbands? 
\v 12 Return home, my daughters. Go on, for I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was hope for me to have a husband tonight and to bear sons, 
\v 13 would you wait for them to grow up? Would you refrain from having husbands? No, my daughters, it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.” 
\b
\m 
\v 14 Again they wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.
