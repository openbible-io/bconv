\s1 The Israelites Multiply in Egypt
\r (Genesis 46:7–27)
\b
\m 
\v 1 These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family: 
\b
\li1 
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 
\b
\li1 
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 
\b
\li1 
\v 4 Dan and Naphtali; 
\b
\li1 Gad and Asher. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy \f + \fr 1:5 \ft MT (see also Genesis 46:27); DSS and LXX (see also Acts 7:14) seventy-five\f* in all, including Joseph, who was already in Egypt. 
\b
\m 
\v 6 Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, 
\v 7 but the Israelites were fruitful and increased rapidly; they multiplied and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them. 
\s1 Oppression by a New King
\r (Acts 7:15–19)
\b
\m 
\v 8 Then a new king, who did not know Joseph, came to power in Egypt. 
\v 9 “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become too numerous and too powerful for us. 
\v 10 Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase even more; and if a war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country.\f + \fr 1:10 \ft Or and take the country\f*” 
\b
\m 
\v 11 So the Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor. As a result, they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 
\v 12 But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and flourished; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.
