\s1 Abishag Cares for David
\b
\m 
\v 1 Now King David was old and well along in years, and though they covered him with blankets, he could not keep warm. 
\v 2 So his servants said to him, “Let us search for a young virgin for our lord the king, to attend to him and care for him and lie by his side to keep him warm.” 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl, and they found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king. 
\v 4 The girl was unsurpassed in beauty; she cared for the king and served him, but he had no relations with her. 
\s1 Adonijah Usurps the Kingdom
\b
\m 
\v 5 At that time Adonijah, David’s son by Haggith, began to exalt himself, saying, “I will be king!” And he acquired chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run ahead of him. 
\b
\m 
\v 6 (His father had never once reprimanded him by saying, “Why do you act this way?” Adonijah was also very handsome, born next after Absalom.) 
\b
\m 
\v 7 So Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, who supported him. 
\v 8 But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David’s mighty men would not join Adonijah. 
\b
\m 
\v 9 And Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened calves near the stone of Zoheleth,\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Or the Serpent’s Stone\f* which is next to En-rogel. He invited all his royal brothers and all the men of Judah who were servants of the king. 
\v 10 But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or his brother Solomon. 
\s1 Nathan and Bathsheba before David
\b
\m 
\v 11 Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, “Have you not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith has become king, and our lord David does not know it? 
\v 12 Now please, come and let me advise you. Save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. 
\v 13 Go at once to King David and say, ‘My lord the king, did you not swear to your maidservant, “Surely your son Solomon will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’ 
\v 14 Then, while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.” 
\b
\m 
\v 15 So Bathsheba went to see the king in his bedroom. Since the king was very old, Abishag the Shunammite was serving him.
