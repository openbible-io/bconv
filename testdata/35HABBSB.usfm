\s1 Habakkuk’s First Complaint
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is the burden that Habakkuk the prophet received in a vision: 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 How long, O LORD, must I call for help 
\q2 but You do not hear, 
\q1 or cry out to You, “Violence!” 
\q2 but You do not save? 
\q1 
\v 3 Why do You make me see iniquity? 
\q2 Why do You tolerate wrongdoing? 
\q1 Destruction and violence are before me. 
\q2 Strife is ongoing, and conflict abounds. 
\q1 
\v 4 Therefore the law is paralyzed, 
\q2 and justice never goes forth. 
\q1 For the wicked hem in the righteous, 
\q2 so that justice is perverted. 
\s1 The LORD’s Answer
\b
\q1 
\v 5 “Look at the nations and observe—
\q2 be utterly astounded!\f + \fr 1:5 \ft LXX Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish!\f* 
\q1 For I am doing a work in your days 
\q2 that you would never believe 
\q2 even if someone told you.\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Cited in Acts 13:41\f* 
\q1 
\v 6 For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans \f + \fr 1:6 \ft That is, the Babylonians\f*—
\q2 that ruthless and impetuous nation 
\q1 which marches through the breadth of the earth 
\q2 to seize dwellings not their own. 
\q1
