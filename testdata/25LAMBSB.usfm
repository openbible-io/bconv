\s1 How Lonely Lies the City!
\r (2 Kings 24:10–17)
\b
\q1 
\v 1 How \f + \fr 1:1 \ft This chapter is an acrostic poem, each verse beginning with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet.\f* lonely lies the city, 
\q2 once so full of people! 
\q1 She who was great among the nations 
\q2 has become a widow. 
\q1 The princess of the provinces 
\q2 has become a slave. 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 She weeps aloud in the night, 
\q2 with tears upon her cheeks. 
\q1 Among all her lovers 
\q2 there is no one to comfort her. 
\q1 All her friends have betrayed her; 
\q2 they have become her enemies. 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 Judah has gone into exile 
\q2 under affliction and harsh slavery; 
\q1 she dwells among the nations 
\q2 but finds no place to rest. 
\q1 All her pursuers have overtaken her 
\q2 in the midst of her distress. 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 The roads to Zion mourn, 
\q2 because no one comes to her appointed feasts. 
\q1 All her gates are deserted; 
\q2 her priests groan, 
\q1 her maidens grieve, 
\q2 and she herself is bitter with anguish.
